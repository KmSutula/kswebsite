    <div id="bio">
    I love learning new tech skills, making striking websites, studying foreign languages, and teaching people about things they didn't know they were interested in.
    As a teacher of 5 years, I am passionate about collaborative learning, brainstorming new methods, and being a lifelong student. Teaching has also made me adaptable, strengthened my problem-solving, and made me an excellent time manager. I am enthusiastic about building professional relationships through exchanging knowledge.
    As a musician for many more years, I enjoy singing with friends in professional and casual settings as often as I can. I love to discover new video games (RPGs especially), spend as much time outside as possible, and strengthening my skills in other languages.
    I hope to soon accept a role as a junior software developer and would love to talk more about any opportunity to do that.
