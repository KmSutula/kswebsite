        <div id="bio">
            <p>I love learning new tech skills, making striking websites, improving my foreign language proficiency, and
                teaching people about things they didn't know they were interested in.</p>

            <p>As a teacher of 5 years, I am passionate about collaborative learning, brainstorming new methods, and
                being a
                lifelong student. Teaching has also made me adaptable, strengthened my problem-solving, and made me an
                excellent time manager. I am enthusiastic about building professional relationships through exchanging
                knowledge.</p>
            <p>As a musician for many more years, I enjoy singing with friends in professional and casual settings as
                often
                as I can. I love to discover new video games (RPGs especially), spend as much time outside as possible,
                and
                cooking up recipes from different cultures.</p>
            <p class="important">I hope to soon accept a role as a junior software developer and would love to talk more
                about any opportunity to do that.</p>
